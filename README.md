# Responsive Website that adjusts its layout for different devices                           

## Overview                        

This project demonstrates a dynamic web layout that adjusts its appearance based on the device's screen size.
The goal is to provide an engaging user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.              

## Features         

### Responsive Navigation Layout:

* The navigation bar automatically adjusts its layout based on the screen width.
* On larger screens, the navigation items are displayed in a row.
* On smaller screens (width â‰¤ 768px), the navigation items stack vertically.

### Custom Cursor Animation:

* A GIF cursor follows the user's mouse movements across the screen, adding an interactive element to the page.

## Implementation

* The custom cursor is implemented using JavaScript to track the mouse movements and update the position of a GIF image accordingly.
* The responsive behavior of the navigation bar is controlled by a function that checks the window width and adjusts the layout classes accordingly.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how to create an adaptive web layout that improves user experience across different devices.               
The custom cursor animation adds an interactive touch, making the website more engaging.
